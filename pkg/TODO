* R-Forge package dependencies
   Generally resolve CRAN/Bioc (i.e. stable) package
   dependencies. Currently R-Forge package dependencies are only
   installed if there is no corresponding "stable" version
   available. In the future, packages in R-Forge should be able to
   force the installation of R-Forge packagies via forcing the version
   number to be larger than on CRAN. E.g., if package foo on R-Forge
   depends on bar, bar is available in version 2.1 and on R-Forge in
   version 2.2, the maintainer of foo should have the possibility to
   install bar from R-Forge via forcing bar (>=2.2) in the DESCRIPTION
