## start recommendations to Kurt

## short term plans
- Kurt has to decide what to do with R-Forge
- in particular there must be someone doing all the sysadmin stuff
(apply patches, security update, maintain the FusionForge/R-Forge
patch set, etc.)
- backup is probably an issue
- setup Linux check machine (at WU)
- incoming platform (flag dependencies as devel or release, WU)
- Mac Server (AT&T)
- Win builder (Dortmund)

## centralize the builds: Push service rather pull service

## AT&T Mac builder (R Foundation)
## Winbuilder TU Dortmund (R Foundation)


## R-Forge stats
1107 (active) Projects = #svn repositories

## CRAN needs Hardware upgrade##

## R-FORGE spam filter/ mailing lists (see Martin Maechler's mail)

## Meielisalp NOTES ##

* outsource to a separate build system

* virtualization (Brian is not a fan of Windows Virtualization but
  Linux/Federa is great)

* Uwe may be not in Dortmund

* Windows builds:

  - either Uwe runs a second winbuilder in Dortmund
  - or Vienna
  - traffic

* Mac builds

  - Mac server hosted somewhere in Europe (R Foundation) where other
  people have access to. (Simon Manages it but has not the only
  account)
  
* Kurt has to guarantee that

* Security issue

* 15 months -> meet with Kurt and discuss what are the priorities for
 finishing things: or other interested parties

* Simon should supervisor that attempt to standardize . but for some
  reaon no good idea  thus Brian has a colleague (expertise++)

* should employ someone who help going from A -> B

* discussion with kurt in August

* backups: copy whole disk to a second system, use a specialized
  system (costy)

* R-Forge meeting with Uwe, Simon and Brian (possibly in Warwick)
