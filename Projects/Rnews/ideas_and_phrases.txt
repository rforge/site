%% open source history and its advantages


%%The source code of open source software is by definition accessible to
%%users.  

%%Open source developers are said to work not for monetary returns, are
%%generally volunteers working together on a project. These members of
%%such a team may come from around the world and rarely meet.

%%This open source movement can be seen as an self-organizing process
%%which releases prototype code frequently which is reviewed by hundreds
%%of peers.   

%%One of the questions that may arise 
%%in this context is how to provide code to other developers
%%or even
%%more important how to collaborate with others to contribute to an open
%%source project. centralized resource for managing projects and
%%source code

%%As
%%collaborative development is a key factor for a lot of 
%%successfully open source projects. 

%%Open source development is
%%generally claimed to produce more bug free
%%code and to be available faster than closed source code. Open source
%%developers are said to work not for monetary returns, are generally
%%volunteers working together on a project. These members of such a
%%team may come from around the world and rarely meet.

%%frequently which is reviewed by hundreds of peers.

%%Typically, users need to have read access to the data associated with
%%a certain project. Some of them (the developers) have write access to
%%the data. Usually there is a maintainer of the code. This person is the project
%%leader or has registered the project. Contributers can make use of the
%%provided facilities or email any changes to the code
%%that they developed---bug fixes, additional functionality---which the
%%maintainer adds to the code after verification.

%% collaboration networks

%% Collaborative networks like social networks where the relationships
%% (connections between two persons) are collaborations. This
%% collaborations can be e.g., co-authoring a research paper or in this
%% case working together on a software project.
%% R-Forge tries to provide this decentralized research or software
%% projects a shared platform where developers can meet, join other
%% interesting projects, exchange knowledge and so forth.
